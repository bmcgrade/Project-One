# Project-One Menu-Driven Clock Display (12/24-Hour Format)

## Project Goals
This C++ project is a console-based clock application that displays two clocks side-by-side: one in 12-hour format and one in 24-hour format. Users interact with a menu to add hours, minutes, or seconds to the clocks or exit the program. The project focused on practicing user input handling, formatted time output, loops, modular functions, and menu-driven program structure.

## Successes
I received full credit for modularization, menu functionality, user input handling, and code execution. My use of clean, readable code with proper naming conventions, whitespace, and in-line comments followed industry standards. 

## Areas for Improvement
One area of improvement would be to fully implement user input for setting the initial time. My program didnâ€™t allow the user to enter a custom time at the start. Adding this feature would better align the code with the intended sequence of functions from the flowchart and improve user control over the starting time.

## Challenges Faced
Formatting the clocks side-by-side and making sure the menu interacted correctly with both formats took some trial and error. Reviewing previous assignments and using reference materials helped me work through this.

## Transferable Skills
This project improved my ability to break problems down into modular functions, handle user input gracefully, and write readable, maintainable code. These skills are valuable for any programming work and applicable in scripting, automation, or interface design tasks across multiple languages.

## Code Maintainability
I kept the code clean with meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and logical function breakdown. I used comments where needed to explain functionality, and followed best practices for C++ structure. These choices make the project easy to revisit and improve in the future.
